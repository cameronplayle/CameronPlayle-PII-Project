The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract

*This project will provide valuable insights into the impact of Tommy John surgery on MLB pitchers' performance. By understanding these effects, teams can better manage pitcher health and make informed decisions about player rehabilitation and development.*

# Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of Tommy John surgery on the performance of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. Tommy John surgery, a common procedure among pitchers, involves reconstructing the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the elbow. This surgery can have significant implications for a pitcher's career, including their performance metrics before and after the surgery. Understanding these impacts can provide insights into the effectiveness of the surgery and help teams make informed decisions regarding player rehabilitation and investment.

## General Background Information

*Tommy John surgery has been a common procedure in baseball, named after the first pitcher to undergo the surgery in 1974. The recovery and return to pre-surgery performance levels can vary widely among pitchers. Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of the surgery on performance, making it a compelling topic for further investigation. This analysis aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding by leveraging recent data and sophisticated analytical techniques.*

## Description of data and data source

*The data for this project will consist of performance statistics of MLB pitchers, collected from public sports databases such as FanGraphs, Baseball-Reference, and MLB's official website. The dataset will include information on pitchers who have undergone Tommy John surgery and those who have not..*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

The primary question to be addressed in this project is:

-   How does Tommy John surgery affect the performance of MLB pitchers?

### Outcome of Interest

-   **Primary Outcome**: Changes in performance metrics such as ERA, strikeouts, walks, innings pitched, and fastball velocity before and after the surgery.

### Predictors

-   **Primary Predictors**:

    -   Surgery status (whether a pitcher has undergone Tommy John surgery)

    -   Time since surgery (for post-surgery performance analysis)

### Expected Patterns and Relations

-   Compare performance metrics of pitchers before and after surgery.

-   Compare performance metrics between pitchers who have had the surgery and those who have not.

-   Investigate if the time since surgery correlates with improvement in performance metrics.

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a].

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Proposed Analysis

The analysis will involve:

-   **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the data and understand basic trends.

-   **Comparative Analysis**: Use t-tests or non-parametric tests to compare the means of performance metrics between different groups (pre- and post-surgery, and between those who have had surgery and those who have not).

-   **Regression Analysis**: Explore the relationship between surgery status and performance metrics while controlling for other variables like age and years of experience.

-   **Time Series Analysis**: If applicable, analyze performance metrics over time to see how they change as a function of time since surgery.

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender. We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```

## Data aquisition

*As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next.*

## Data import and cleaning

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

## Statistical analysis

*Explain anything related to your statistical analyses.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

*Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project.*

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like.
