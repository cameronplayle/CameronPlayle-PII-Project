# Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of Tommy John surgery on the performance of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. Tommy John surgery, a common procedure among pitchers, involves reconstructing the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the elbow. This surgery can have significant implications for a pitcher's career, including their performance metrics before and after the surgery. Understanding these impacts can provide insights into the effectiveness of the surgery and help teams make informed decisions regarding player rehabilitation and investment.

## General Background Information

*Tommy John surgery has been a common procedure in baseball, named after the first pitcher to undergo the surgery in 1974. The recovery and return to pre-surgery performance levels can vary widely among pitchers. Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of the surgery on performance, making it a compelling topic for further investigation. This analysis aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding by leveraging recent data and sophisticated analytical techniques.*

## Description of data and data source

*The data for this project will consist of performance statistics of MLB pitchers, collected from public sports databases such as FanGraphs, Baseball-Reference, and MLB's official website. The dataset will include information on pitchers who have undergone Tommy John surgery and those who have not..*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

The primary question to be addressed in this project is:

-   How does Tommy John surgery affect the performance of MLB pitchers?

### Outcome of Interest

-   **Primary Outcome**: Changes in performance metrics such as ERA, strikeouts, walks, innings pitched, and fastball velocity before and after the surgery.

### Predictors

-   **Primary Predictors**:

    -   Surgery status (whether a pitcher has undergone Tommy John surgery)

    -   Time since surgery (for post-surgery performance analysis)

### Expected Patterns and Relations

-   Compare performance metrics of pitchers before and after surgery.

-   Compare performance metrics between pitchers who have had the surgery and those who have not.

-   Investigate if the time since surgery correlates with improvement in performance metrics.

# Methods

#### Data Collection

The data for this project were sourced from publicly available sports databases, including FanGraphs, Baseball-Reference, and MLB's official website. The dataset comprises performance metrics for Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers, focusing on those who have undergone Tommy John surgery (TJS) and those who have not. The primary performance metrics analyzed include Earned Run Average (ERA), strikeouts, walks, innings pitched, and fastball velocity. Data were collected across multiple seasons to capture the pitchers' performance both before and after surgery.

#### Data Preprocessing

Several preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the data for analysis:

1.  **Data Cleaning**:

    -   Missing values were addressed by excluding records that lacked essential information, such as surgery status or key performance metrics.

    -   Duplicates were removed to ensure each pitcher-season combination was unique.

    -   Outliers were identified through summary statistics and visual inspection and were either corrected or excluded from the analysis as necessary.

2.  **Feature Engineering**:

    -   Variables were created to quantify the time since surgery for pitchers who had undergone TJS.

    -   Performance metrics were averaged over pre- and post-surgery periods for pitchers who had undergone TJS, facilitating direct comparisons.

3.  **Normalization**:

    -   Continuous variables such as pitch speed and innings pitched were normalized to standardize comparisons across different pitchers and seasons.

#### Statistical Analysis

The analysis focused on assessing the impact of Tommy John surgery on MLB pitchers' performance, using two primary modeling approaches: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

1.  **Descriptive Statistics**:

    -   Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were computed for key performance metrics, both before and after surgery.

    -   Visualizations, including histograms and boxplots, were generated to explore the distribution of performance metrics across different groups.

2.  **Logistic Regression**:

    -   Logistic regression was employed to model the likelihood of a pitcher undergoing TJS based on their pre-surgery performance metrics.

    -   The model included predictor variables such as ERA, strikeouts, and fastball velocity to assess their association with surgery status.

    -   The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated using metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

3.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:

    -   An SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used to predict post-surgery performance outcomes based on pre-surgery metrics.

    -   The SVM model was tuned and evaluated using cross-validation to avoid overfitting and ensure robust performance.

    -   The model\'s performance was assessed using ROC curves, with AUC as the primary metric.

#### Software and Tools

All analyses were performed using R (version 4.3.3), with the `tidymodels` framework for modeling, `dplyr` for data manipulation, and `ggplot2` for visualization. Quarto was used for project management and documentation, ensuring reproducibility and transparency of the analysis.

## Proposed Analysis

The analysis will involve:

-   **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the data and understand basic trends.

-   **Comparative Analysis**: Use t-tests or non-parametric tests to compare the means of performance metrics between different groups (pre- and post-surgery, and between those who have had surgery and those who have not).

-   **Regression Analysis**: Explore the relationship between surgery status and performance metrics while controlling for other variables like age and years of experience.

-   **Time Series Analysis**: If applicable, analyze performance metrics over time to see how they change as a function of time since surgery.

## Data aquisition

*Data came straight from MLB's website* <https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/> and <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQujXQQGOVNaiuwSN680Hq-FDVsCwvN-3AazykOBON0/edit?gid=0#gid=0>

## Data import and cleaning

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

The analysis of pitch metrics between pitchers who have undergone Tommy John surgery (TJS) and those who have not reveals several noteworthy findings.

1.  **Spin Rate Comparison**:

    -   The first graph comparing average spin rates across different pitch types for pitchers with and without TJS indicates that there is no substantial difference in spin rates between the two groups across all pitch types. For instance, the spin rates for pitches such as changeup (avg_ch_spin) and fastball (avg_ff_spin) remain relatively consistent regardless of surgery status. This suggests that TJS does not significantly alter a pitcher\'s ability to generate spin on the ball.

2.  **Speed Comparison**:

    -   The second graph compares average pitch speeds across different pitch types for pitchers with and without TJS. The results indicate a minor variation in pitch speeds between the two groups. While the fastball (avg_ff_speed) shows a slight reduction in speed for pitchers who underwent TJS, the difference is not markedly significant across other pitch types like slider (avg_sl_speed) and changeup (avg_ch_speed). This implies that TJS has a minimal impact on a pitcher\'s velocity post-surgery.

3.  **Overall Spin Rate Distribution**:

    -   The third graph presents the distribution of average spin rates for different pitch types, without considering surgery status. It is evident that there is considerable variability in spin rates across pitch types, with curveballs (avg_cu_spin) and sliders (avg_sl_spin) exhibiting higher spin rates compared to fastballs (avg_ff_spin) and changeups (avg_ch_spin). This variability aligns with the mechanical differences inherent in each pitch type.

4.  **Overall Speed Distribution**:

    -   The final graph shows the distribution of average pitch speeds for different pitch types. Fastballs (avg_ff_speed) naturally exhibit the highest velocities, followed by cutters (avg_fc_speed), with changeups (avg_ch_speed) and curveballs (avg_cu_speed) being slower as expected due to their strategic purpose in gameplay. The wide range of speeds within each pitch type highlights the diversity in pitching styles and techniques among MLB pitchers.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that Tommy John surgery does not significantly impact a pitcher\'s spin rate or velocity, implying that pitchers are likely to retain their pitch characteristics post-surgery. The overall distribution of spin rates and speeds further illustrates the inherent differences between pitch types, which remain consistent irrespective of TJS.

## Full analysis

### Statistical Analysis Discussion

The logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between various pitch metrics and the likelihood of a Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher undergoing Tommy John surgery (TJS). The model was fitted using the `glm` function in R, with the surgery status (TJS) as the binary dependent variable and the pitch metrics as independent variables.

#### Preprocessing

Before fitting the model, a preprocessing step was applied to normalize the predictor variables. This normalization step ensures that all predictors are on a similar scale, which is particularly important when using logistic regression as it can improve model convergence and interpretability.

#### Model Coefficients

The coefficients from the logistic regression model represent the log-odds of undergoing TJS for a one-unit increase in each predictor, holding all other variables constant. The coefficients indicate the direction and strength of the association between each pitch metric and the likelihood of TJS:

-   **Intercept**: The negative intercept (-55.509) suggests that, at baseline (when all pitch metrics are zero), the log-odds of undergoing TJS are very low. However, since pitch metrics are not zero in reality, this intercept is more of a starting point for the model.

-   **avg_ff_speed**: A negative coefficient (-4.841) indicates that an increase in average fastball speed (avg_ff_speed) is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of undergoing TJS. This could suggest that pitchers with higher fastball speeds are less likely to need the surgery, possibly due to better overall arm health or mechanics.

-   **avg_ff_spin**: The positive coefficient (8.659) for fastball spin rate (avg_ff_spin) suggests that higher spin rates may be associated with an increased likelihood of undergoing TJS. This could reflect the greater stress placed on the arm by pitches with high spin rates.

-   **avg_ch_speed** and **avg_ch_spin**: Both changeup speed (-33.950) and spin (-13.173) have negative coefficients, indicating that higher values of these metrics are associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing TJS. This might suggest that pitchers who rely more on off-speed pitches, which are generally less taxing on the arm, are less likely to require surgery.

-   **avg_cu_speed** and **avg_cu_spin**: The coefficients for curveball speed (63.566) and spin (-26.594) are mixed, with speed showing a positive relationship and spin a negative one. This indicates a complex relationship where faster curveballs might be linked to a higher likelihood of surgery, while higher spin rates are associated with a lower likelihood.

-   **avg_fc_speed** and **avg_fc_spin**: Cutter speed (28.836) and spin (50.143) both have positive coefficients, suggesting that higher values in these metrics are linked to an increased likelihood of TJS. This could indicate that the cutter, which is a demanding pitch on the elbow, increases the risk of surgery.

-   **avg_sl_speed** and **avg_sl_spin**: Both slider speed (-67.538) and spin (-50.581) have strongly negative coefficients, implying that pitchers with higher values in these metrics are less likely to undergo TJS. This could suggest that pitchers who effectively use sliders without overexerting their arms might avoid surgery.

#### Model Fit

-   **Degrees of Freedom**: The model had 26 total degrees of freedom, with 16 residual degrees of freedom. This indicates that the model used 10 predictors (including the intercept) to explain the variability in the outcome.

-   **Deviance**: The null deviance (25.87) indicates the deviance of a model with no predictors, while the residual deviance (1.099e-09) shows the deviance after the model is fitted. The significant reduction in deviance suggests that the model fits the data well, as it accounts for almost all of the variation in the outcome.

-   **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**: The AIC value of 22 indicates the model's goodness of fit, with lower values representing better-fitting models. The low AIC value suggests that the model is relatively well-suited to the data.

### Interpretation and Implications

Overall, the logistic regression model indicates that various pitch metrics are significantly associated with the likelihood of undergoing Tommy John surgery. The direction and magnitude of the coefficients provide insights into which pitch characteristics might increase or decrease this likelihood. For example, higher fastball speeds and lower slider speeds are associated with different risks of TJS, highlighting the nuanced impact of different pitch types on pitcher health.

These findings can be valuable for coaches, trainers, and medical staff in developing strategies to prevent TJS, such as monitoring and adjusting pitchers' mechanics or pitch selection. However, it's important to consider that this model is based on observational data, and causality cannot be directly inferred from these associations. Further research, possibly including biomechanical studies, could provide more definitive insights into these relationships.

### Interpretation of the ROC Curve:

1.  **Axes Explanation**:

    -   **X-Axis (1 - Specificity)**: This represents the false positive rate (FPR). A lower value indicates fewer false positives, which is desirable.

    -   **Y-Axis (Sensitivity)**: This represents the true positive rate (TPR), or the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model.

2.  **The ROC Curve**:

    -   The curve itself plots sensitivity against 1-specificity for different threshold values of the model's predicted probabilities.

    -   A model with good discriminatory ability will have a curve that hugs the top-left corner, indicating high sensitivity (true positive rate) and low 1-specificity (false positive rate).

3.  **Diagonal Line**:

    -   The diagonal line represents the performance of a random classifier, which would produce a sensitivity equal to 1-specificity (i.e., no discrimination between the classes).

4.  **Your ROC Curve**:

    -   The ROC curve in your plot quickly rises towards the top-left corner and then flattens out near the top. This shape suggests that the model is performing well, as it achieves a high sensitivity with a low false positive rate.

5.  **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**:

    -   Although not explicitly shown in the plot, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric to summarize the ROC curve. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect model, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a model with no discriminatory ability (equivalent to random guessing).

    -   Given the shape of your curve, the AUC is likely close to 1, indicating strong performance.

### Conclusion:

This ROC curve indicates that the model used for predicting the likelihood of Tommy John surgery (TJS) has strong discriminatory power, effectively distinguishing between those who will and will not undergo the surgery based on the input features. The model's high sensitivity with a low false positive rate suggests it is reliable in identifying true positives while minimizing false positives.

```{r}
# Ensure TJS is a factor
test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(TJS = as.factor(TJS))

# Generate predictions (assuming svm_fit is your fitted model)
svm_predictions <- predict(svm_fit, new_data = test_data, type = "prob")

# Combine predictions with test data
test_results <- bind_cols(test_data, svm_predictions)

# Calculate ROC curve data
roc_curve_data_svm <- roc_curve(test_results, truth = TJS, .pred_1)

# Print ROC curve results
print(roc_curve_data_svm)

```

### Interpretation of the Table:

1.  **Threshold (.threshold)**:

    -   The `.threshold` column shows the cutoff points for deciding whether a prediction is classified as a positive or negative case.

    -   Lower thresholds mean more predictions will be classified as positive, which increases sensitivity but decreases specificity.

    -   Higher thresholds mean fewer predictions will be classified as positive, which increases specificity but decreases sensitivity.

2.  **Specificity**:

    -   Specificity represents the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified by the model.

    -   A specificity of `1.00` means that the model correctly identifies all true negatives, while a specificity of `0.00` means it fails to identify any true negatives.

3.  **Sensitivity**:

    -   Sensitivity (also known as the true positive rate or recall) measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the model.

    -   A sensitivity of `1.00` means the model correctly identifies all true positives, while a sensitivity of `0.00` means it fails to identify any true positives.

### Detailed Analysis:

-   **Low Threshold (e.g., -Inf, 0.1042050)**:

    -   Sensitivity is high (`1.00`), meaning the model identifies all cases of TJS. However, specificity is low (`0.00`), meaning the model incorrectly classifies many non-TJS cases as TJS.

    -   This situation might be useful in scenarios where it's crucial not to miss any true cases, even at the cost of many false positives.

-   **Mid Threshold (e.g., 0.2115467, 0.2242692)**:

    -   Here, the model achieves a balance between sensitivity and specificity. For instance, at a threshold of `0.2115467`, specificity is `0.50` and sensitivity is `0.6666667`.

    -   This balance can be useful in contexts where both false positives and false negatives are costly.

-   **High Threshold (e.g., Inf)**:

    -   At very high thresholds, sensitivity drops to `0.00` (no true positives identified), while specificity increases to `1.00` (all true negatives correctly identified).

    -   This scenario might be chosen in situations where false positives must be minimized, even if it means missing some true cases.

### Conclusion:

The choice of threshold depends on the context of the problem and the relative costs of false positives versus false negatives. For instance, in a medical context, you might prefer a lower threshold to ensure that no true cases of TJS are missed, even if it means accepting more false positives. The table provides a way to visualize these trade-offs and helps in selecting an appropriate threshold based on your specific needs.

# Define an SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel
svm_model <- svm_rbf() %>%
  set_engine("kernlab") %>%

# Create a workflow
svm_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(svm_model)

# Fit the model and assign it to svm_fit
svm_fit <- svm_workflow %>%

# Convert TJS to a factor if it isn't already
test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(TJS = as.factor(TJS))

# Generate predictions and combine with test data
svm_predictions <- predict(svm_fit, new_data = test_data, type = "prob")
test_results <- bind_cols(test_data, svm_predictions)

str(test_results)

# Generate and plot ROC curve
roc_curve_data_svm <- roc_curve(test_results, truth = TJS, .pred_1)
autoplot(roc_curve_data_svm)
```

### Key Elements of the ROC Curve:

1.  **X-Axis (1 - Specificity)**:

    -   The x-axis represents the false positive rate (1 - specificity).

    -   A lower value indicates fewer false positives, meaning the model is better at correctly identifying negatives.

2.  **Y-Axis (Sensitivity)**:

    -   The y-axis represents the true positive rate (sensitivity or recall).

    -   A higher value indicates more true positives, meaning the model is better at correctly identifying positives.

3.  **The Diagonal Line**:

    -   The diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right corner represents the performance of a random classifier, which has no discriminatory power between the positive and negative classes.

4.  **The ROC Curve**:

    -   The ROC curve itself is plotted based on different threshold values for classifying observations.

    -   The curve starts at the origin (0,0) and ideally moves towards the top-left corner, which represents a perfect classifier.

### Interpretation of the Curve:

-   **Curve Shape**:

    -   The curve you provided shows an initial rise in sensitivity (up to 1.0) with some increase in the false positive rate. However, the curve does not immediately reach the top-left corner, indicating that the model is not perfectly discriminating between the two classes.

    -   The steps in the curve suggest that there are relatively few distinct prediction values, leading to fewer threshold options for classification.

-   **Model Performance**:

    -   A curve that stays close to the top-left corner of the plot would indicate a better-performing model. In this case, the curve steps up relatively early but has a plateau and then rises again, showing some trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at certain thresholds.

    -   The area under the curve (AUC) is not explicitly shown, but based on the shape, the AUC would likely be moderate, suggesting that the model has some predictive power but is not highly accurate.

### Conclusion:

This ROC curve suggests that your model has a reasonable ability to discriminate between the two classes (TJS vs. non-TJS), but it is not perfect. The steps in the curve indicate that as you adjust the classification threshold, you can trade off between sensitivity and specificity, but there are limitations due to the relatively small number of distinct prediction values. Improving the model might involve exploring additional features, tuning hyperparameters, or trying alternative modeling techniques.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

#### Overview:

In this analysis, we explored the impact of Tommy John surgery (TJS) on MLB pitchers' performance metrics, specifically focusing on pitch speed and spin rate across different pitch types. We employed logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models to predict the likelihood of a pitcher undergoing Tommy John surgery based on these metrics. The models were evaluated using ROC curves to understand their discriminatory power.

#### Key Steps:

1.  **Data Preparation:**

    -   The dataset was cleaned and missing values were removed.

    -   Pitch metrics, including average pitch speed and spin rates for various pitch types (fastball, curveball, slider, etc.), were computed.

    -   The data was split into training and testing sets, and the predictors were normalized.

2.  **Modeling:**

    -   A logistic regression model was developed to predict the occurrence of TJS based on the pitch metrics.

    -   An SVM model with a radial basis function kernel was also trained for the same purpose.

    -   Both models were evaluated using ROC curves to assess their performance.

3.  **Visualization:**

    -   Box plots were generated to compare pitch speeds and spin rates between pitchers with and without TJS.

    -   ROC curves were plotted to visualize the models' true positive rates (sensitivity) against their false positive rates (1-specificity).

#### Findings:

1.  **Logistic Regression:**

    -   The logistic regression model identified several pitch metrics as significant predictors of TJS, including fastball speed, curveball speed, and slider spin rate.

    -   The model's ROC curve indicated a moderate ability to discriminate between pitchers who had undergone TJS and those who had not.

2.  **Support Vector Machine:**

    -   The SVM model provided another approach to classify pitchers based on their pitch metrics.

    -   The ROC curve for the SVM model showed a moderate but somewhat limited performance, suggesting that the model struggled with precise classification at certain thresholds.

3.  **Pitch Metrics Comparison:**

    -   The box plots revealed that pitchers who had undergone TJS tended to have lower average speeds and spin rates for certain pitch types, though the differences were not always substantial.

    -   This suggests that while TJS may impact some aspects of a pitcher's performance, the relationship is complex and varies across different pitch metrics.

#### Interpretation:

-   **Model Performance:**

    -   Both the logistic regression and SVM models demonstrated some ability to predict TJS based on pitch metrics, but neither model was exceptionally strong. This could be due to the complexity of the factors influencing TJS or the limitations of the available data.

    -   The ROC curves showed that there are trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, with no clear threshold providing perfect classification. This indicates that while these models can help identify pitchers at risk of TJS, they are not definitive.

-   **Pitch Metrics Impact:**

    -   The findings suggest that certain pitch characteristics, like reduced velocity and altered spin rates, could be associated with TJS. However, these metrics alone may not fully capture the risk factors, and further research incorporating additional variables (like injury history or biomechanics) may be necessary.

    -   The variability in the impact of TJS on different pitch types underscores the need for individualized assessments of pitchers' performance post-surgery.

## Strengths and Limitations

#### Strengths:

1.  **Comprehensive Analysis:**

    -   The analysis utilized multiple statistical models (logistic regression and SVM) to explore the relationship between pitch metrics and the likelihood of Tommy John surgery. This multi-model approach provides a more robust understanding of the data and helps identify consistent patterns across different analytical methods.

2.  **Use of Real-World Data:**

    -   The study employed actual MLB pitch data, ensuring that the findings are relevant and applicable to real-world scenarios. This enhances the practical significance of the results, particularly for teams and sports professionals involved in player management and rehabilitation.

3.  **Visualization of Results:**

    -   The use of visual tools such as box plots and ROC curves effectively communicated the findings, making it easier to identify trends and interpret the models' performance. These visualizations are valuable for both technical and non-technical audiences, aiding in the understanding of complex data.

4.  **Focus on Multiple Pitch Metrics:**

    -   By examining a range of pitch types and their corresponding speeds and spin rates, the analysis provided a nuanced view of how Tommy John surgery might impact different aspects of a pitcher's performance. This level of detail allows for more specific insights, potentially leading to more targeted interventions.

#### Limitations:

1.  **Model Performance:**

    -   The models, particularly the logistic regression and SVM, demonstrated only moderate predictive power. This suggests that while pitch metrics are related to Tommy John surgery, they may not be sufficient as standalone predictors. Other factors, such as biomechanics, workload, and injury history, which were not included in the analysis, may also play crucial roles.

2.  **Data Limitations:**

    -   The analysis was constrained by the availability and completeness of the data. Missing values had to be removed, which could potentially bias the results if the missing data was not random. Additionally, the data used may not capture all relevant variables affecting a pitcher's likelihood of undergoing Tommy John surgery.

3.  **Small Sample Size for Some Pitch Types:**

    -   Certain pitch types had fewer data points, which might limit the reliability of the results for those specific pitches. The variability in sample size across different pitch types could affect the generalizability of the findings.

4.  **Potential Overfitting:**

    -   Given the small residual degrees of freedom in the logistic regression model, there is a risk of overfitting, particularly in the presence of a high number of predictors relative to the number of observations. Overfitting can lead to models that perform well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

5.  **Limited Scope of Predictors:**

    -   While pitch metrics are important, the analysis did not include other potentially significant predictors, such as player age, years of professional experience, previous injuries, or training regimens. These factors could provide a more comprehensive view of the risks and outcomes associated with Tommy John surgery.

## Conclusions

The analysis provided valuable insights into the impact of Tommy John surgery on MLB pitchers' performance, particularly in relation to pitch metrics. However, the moderate performance of the predictive models and the limitations in data and methodology suggest that further research is needed. Expanding the scope of data, refining the models, and incorporating additional relevant predictors could enhance the accuracy and applicability of the findings. Despite these limitations, the study contributes to the ongoing efforts to understand and mitigate the effects of Tommy John surgery in professional baseball.
